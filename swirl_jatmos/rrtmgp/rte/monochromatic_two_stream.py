  """Compute the monochromatic shortwave fluxes in a layered atmosphere.

  The direct-beam downward flux `flux_down_dir` is added to the downwelling
  diffuse flux in the final solution.

  The upwelling and downwelling diffuse fluxes are computed from the equations
  of Shonk and Hogan.  The net flux is also computed at every face.  Note that
  the net flux is computed only at cell interfaces and does not correspond to
  the net flux into or out of the cell.  For the overall grid cell net flux, one
  must take the difference of the net fluxes of the upper and bottom faces.

  Args:
    t_diff: Cell center transmittance, 3D field
    r_diff: Cell center reflectance, 3D field.
    src_up: Cell center upward source, 3D field.
    src_down: Cell center downward source, 3D field.
    sfc_src: Direct-beam shortwave radiation reflected upward from the surface,
      2D field.
    sfc_albedo: The surface albedo, 2D field.
    flux_down_dir: The downwelling direct-beam radiative flux at the cell faces,
      3D field.
    use_scan: Whether to use scan or for loops for the recurrent operation.

  Returns:
    A dictionary containing fluxes at the z faces:
      'flux_up': The upwelling radiative flux.
      'flux_down': The downwelling radiative flux.
      'net_flux': The net radiative flux.
