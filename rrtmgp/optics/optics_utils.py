  """Interpolate coefficients linearly according to the `interpolant_fns`.

  The `interpolant_fns` are provided as functions taking in a dictionary of
  `IndexAndWeight` objects that the interpolant might depend on and returning
  an `Interpolant` object. This is particularly useful when the variables used
  to index into `coeffs` have dependencies between them. Take as an example the
  RRTMGP `kmajor` coefficient table, which is indexed by temperature, pressure,
  and the relative abundance fraction. Temperature and pressure are independent
  variables, but the relative abundance calculation depends on both of them.
  Providing the interpolant as a function allows a straightforward expression of
  this dependency.

  For example, if `coeffs` has rank 2, where the first axis is indexed by a
  variable `t`, the second axis is indexed by a variable `s`, and `s` depends on
  `t`, the interpolation can be done as follows:

  independent_t_interpolant = create_linear_interpolant(t, t_ref)

  def dependent_s_interpolant_func(dep: Dict[Text, IndexAndWeight]):
    t_idx = dep['t'].idx
