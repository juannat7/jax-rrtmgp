              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# JAX-RRTMGP: JAX-based RRTMGP Radiative Transfer

*This is not an officially supported Google product.*

JAX-RRTMGP is a JAX-based implementation of the RRTMGP (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General circulation models - Parallel) radiative transfer scheme. This package provides fast, differentiable radiative transfer calculations for atmospheric modeling applications.

RRTMGP is a correlated k-distribution model for computing optical depths, source functions, and fluxes for longwave and shortwave radiation in planetary atmospheres. This JAX implementation enables automatic differentiation and efficient execution on GPUs and TPUs.

## Features

- **JAX-native implementation**: Full compatibility with JAX transformations (jit, grad, vmap, pmap)
- **GPU/TPU acceleration**: Efficient execution on modern accelerators
- **Automatic differentiation**: Enable gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analysis
- **Longwave and shortwave radiation**: Complete radiative transfer calculations
- **Gas and cloud optics**: Support for molecular absorption and cloud scattering/absorption
- **RRTMGP data files included**: Pre-computed optical property lookup tables
- **Comprehensive testing**: Extensive test suite with reference data

## Installation

It is recommended to install in a virtual environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/climate-analytics-lab/jax-rrtmgp.git
python3 -m pip install -e jax-rrtmgp
```

## Basic Usage

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from swirl_jatmos.rrtmgp import rrtmgp

# Set up atmospheric state
temperature = jnp.array([...])  # Temperature profile [K]
pressure = jnp.array([...])     # Pressure profile [Pa] 
vmr_h2o = jnp.array([...])      # Water vapor volume mixing ratio

# Initialize RRTMGP
config = rrtmgp.get_default_config()
rrtmgp_state = rrtmgp.initialize(config, pressure, temperature, vmr_h2o)

# Compute radiative fluxes
fluxes_lw = rrtmgp.compute_longwave_fluxes(rrtmgp_state, ...)
fluxes_sw = rrtmgp.compute_shortwave_fluxes(rrtmgp_state, ...)
```

## Package Structure

- `rrtmgp`: Main RRTMGP interface
- `rrtmgp.optics`: Gas and cloud optical property calculations
